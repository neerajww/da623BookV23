## Project Title
Sound Visualiser

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyse audio signals and extract some of its features and visually represent the audio so that the viewer can somehow feel the audio by viewing at the visual.

## Background
An audio signal or sound signal has many features, such as frequency, intensity, noise, etc. To study the signal more effectively, we are trying to visualize the signal. In investment banking, some traders analyse the performance of a particular stock by converting its stock value (in graph) to audio signals and listening to them to work efficiently. We are similarly converting an audio signal into a visual signal.

## Methodology
We will take an audio and we will extract the frequencies and their corresponding amplitudes. We will use fourier transform on the audio signal to get the frequencies and amplitudes. And will map different frequencies of the audio with different colors so that the viewer distinguish the sounds. Depending upon the amplitudes of particular frequencies some geometrical shapes of corresponding area will be used to visualize those frequencies.

## Deliverables
* A web application to visually represent an audio signal in a visual showing different frequencies with different colours and their respective intensities.
* A GitHub repository containing the source code and documentation of the project.
* An oral presentation in class.

## Input to be used
1. We will use songs in mp3 format as input. We will also use YouTube URLs as input.
