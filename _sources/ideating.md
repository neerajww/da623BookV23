# Ideation: Topics, utilities, and datasets

In the class we had an ideation and discussed briefly about the following topics.

* Physiological disorder analysis using varied kinds of body signals available as open-access datasets
* Weather analysis and prediction
    * Exploring factors quantifying temperature variation
* Signal separation from a mixture of signals
    * $y(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t) + … + x_n(t)$
    * Vocal separation from music, Signal and noise (denosing, or signal enhancement)
* Signal generation - signal synthesis
    * Speech synthesis 
    * Music synthesis
* Signal compression
    * Signal modeling, Analyzing parameters, Impact of quantization, Packet loss, Reconstruction
* Image/video/audio watermarking - forensics  
* … and more
