# Project Plan Meet

> This project plan explicitly encourages the iterative nature of research as a series of questions and answers that gradually refine your hypotheses.

1. You will start by recollecting the course material taught in the intial classes. To help you, we discussed the following.
    * Got introduced to the complexities in natural signals, such as speech, audio, images, weather, chemical, brain signals, respiratory signals, text etc.
    * How to model signals? Models are based on assumptions, and help us proceed by applying the knowledge we read and learn.
    * The scientific process - hypothesize, collect data, model data, accuracy in predicting the past, make prediction for future.

2. Using the above steps you will make a vaguely formed hypothesis of interest to you. It is here that you team up with a few friends and form your ``project pod``. Your pod can have 1-6 team members. A team with members interested in similar ideas is cool, and if all members come from diverse background than it can be great! Please note that at this point you need not know the solution to the hypothesis but are interested to walk the path and enjoy the journey in figuring out the solution.

3. Your proposal will not be perfect, because you still donâ€™t know much about the data or about a phenomenon of interest at point 2. But you have a team. You go back to the course material (and syllabus), develop knowledge about your topic, distribute task amongst the members and discuss ideas like:
    * is the topic interesting
    * from where do you get the data
    * what will the story of the project after its successful execution

4. Your pod will write a short abstract (1-2 page, with one block diagram) about your project, which may or may not include results, but it should at least include a testable hypothesis.

5. Abstracts will be hosted in the website. Feedback will be collected from other groups and instructors.

5. For the rest of the course, you will focus on getting evidence for/against your hypothesis by following the scientific process listed in point 1.

6. In the final project presentation day, you will meet with all the pods and tell the story of your project - what, why, how, and why - of it.

> Goal is to learn how to solve something you are curious about and have fun doing this.
