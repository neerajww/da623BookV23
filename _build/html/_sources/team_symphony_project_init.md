## Project Title
Beat Synchronizer

## Objective
The objective of this project is to extract key features from music samples, like beats, and process them to create video effects that make it sync to the corresponding music.

## Background
When music is synced properly to a video, it creates a symphony effect in our mind. Our mind can subconciously trace musical patterns based on features like loudness, pitch and tempo from music. We aim to extract such features, feed them to functions which control the progress speed and transitions in the video to generate a video which is synced to the corresponding music.

## Methodology
We will use music samples, and extract key features from them using some python libraries. We will use these inputs to speed up/down the video, and add transitions, thus creating an entertaining visual effect.

## Deliverables
* A .ipynb notebook detailing the analysis of music samples.
* A GitHub repository containing the source code and documentation of the project.
* An oral presentation in class.
